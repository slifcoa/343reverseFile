Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too.
Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people they don't like.
Money and success don't change people; they merely amplify what is already there.
